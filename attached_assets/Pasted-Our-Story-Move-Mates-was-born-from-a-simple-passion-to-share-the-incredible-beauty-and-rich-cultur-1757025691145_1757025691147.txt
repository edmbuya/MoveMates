Our Story
Move Mates was born from a simple passion: to share the incredible beauty and rich culture of Kenya with travelers from around the world. Founded in 2020, we started as a small team of local tourism enthusiasts who wanted to create authentic, meaningful travel experiences.

What began as guided tours around Nairobi has evolved into a comprehensive travel service offering everything from wildlife safaris to luxury accommodations. Our deep love for Kenya and commitment to exceptional service has made us a trusted partner for thousands of visitors.

Today, Move Mates stands as a bridge between Kenya's natural wonders and travelers seeking authentic experiences, combining local expertise with world-class hospitality.
